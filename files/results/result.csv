The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act seeks to provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment with minimum wages in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work and register their names with the LGs concerned. All the workers irrespective of gender are entitled to get equal wages under the programme. MGNREGP is a demand driven programme.
In the recent years, considering the job loss in many sectors particularly due to the floods in two successive years and the Covid 19 pandemic, the State Government has initiated many steps to utilize the full potential of MGNREGP through convergence with other departmental schemes that focus on similar focal points and by meticulous planning and earnest implementation.

        Reliable local services, inclusive local policies and effective partnership within local communities are crucial to achieve stability, promoting sustainable development and increasing quality of life of citizens, ensuring the protection of environment as also scarce resources at local levels.  In order to achieve this, the citizens also should have the capacity to put forward their needs and ideas to improve their community and hold the local governments accountable. This capacity building is possible only through need based training being arranged to selected citizens from the Gramasabhas/Oorukoottams at grass root levels. This is quite possible by decentralising the training programmes of KILA further to the districts and lower levels, in collaboration with DPCs in each district. 
The outlay provided is for the programmes of KILA and for meeting the expenses towards the development of five sub centres handed over to KILA.

6. Kerala Cashew Board Ltd (Outlay: ₹3730.00 lakh).
        As State endeavor to tackle various problems faced by Cashew Industry in the State, a Special Purpose Vehicle as a Private Limited Company called ‘Kerala Cashew Board Limited’ was formed. It has equity contribution of 49% by Government of Kerala, and balance 51% by KSCDC, CAPEX, other similar agencies & individuals. The main objectives of the company are to procure raw cashew either from within India or import from outside; enable processing, value addition and marketing of produce in domestic and international markets, supply raw cashew nut to domestic cashew processors at fair price, and to promote scientific cultivation of cashew involving land owners, processors and other stakeholders to enhance domestic raw nut production.
        The total requirement of raw cashew nut for ensuring maximum 300 days employment per year is 8 lakh tonnes, whereas, the indigenous availability is only 85,000 tonne. Industry is heavily dependent on import of raw cashew nut from other cashew producing countries.

KCB is committed to pay 80% of the cost of imported raw nut on its arrival and the prospective buyers of raw cashew nut from KCB are not in a position to make advance payments. The resultant gap in resources of KCB is to be bridged through a revolving fund for ensuring the uninterrupted availability of funds for completing the procurement cycle.
